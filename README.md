This repository contains all of the resources necessary to visualise the progression of the Toronto housing market from 2001 to 2016 in the form of a dashboard with interactive charts.

---

There are some requirements.  

To render the plots you must have installed on your local machine:
 - Python (3.7 reccommended)
 - Jupyter lab
 - Panel
 - Plotly
 - Pandas 1.1.0 (To render the sunburst chart)
 - Numpy 1.21.0 (To render the sunburst chart)
 - A free mapbox api key found at [Mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)

----
If you don't already have your mapbox key set up in a .env file [here](https://medium.com/technology-hits/working-with-maps-in-python-with-mapbox-and-plotly-6f454522ccdd) is a link that will help you to do so.

To run the dashboard simply open up the dashboard.ipynb in Jupyter lab and run the whole notebook

Enjoy!
